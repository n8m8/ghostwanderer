# InSpector
#### A Game by Red Like Rouge

## About The Game
InSpector is a puzzle-driven mystery adventure where your character discovers they can separate from their body and enter the Spirit World. Use your abilities and the environment to learn why you have these ghost powers, and discover the intentions of the group behind it.

## About This Project
This is a game created for the EECS 390: Advanced Game Development Project and Game Production II/III classes at Case Western Reserve University and Cleveland Institute of Art. It is a collaborative class where students from both schools create teams of 10-15 to make a game in one semester to practice programming, creating art assets, and working in a professional environment on a team size larger than what you typically see in a university class. Led by Robert Brown (CIA), Anthony Calabro (CIA), and Dr. Michael Fu (CWRU).
